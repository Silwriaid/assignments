var str = "         lots of spaces before and after         ";
//look in core to "trim" the above string of all spaces  - output to id = trimmed

//look in manipulation / DOM insertion to add "Hello" at beginning (inside) of element where id = addtext

//set a click event on button (mouse events) to toggle between show / hide of all paragraphs (look in effects)
